# Battleship-Personal-Project
This project is a personal work of mine and served as a first attempt at making a python game, a spinoff version of battleship.
I made this project while I was a sophmore in high school, taking the knowledge I learned from my AP Computer Science Principles class and applying it to a game-like scenario. 
This took me roughly 3 weeks of on and off work at the time, and I received help from both my teacher and my classmates in making it. It also served as my submission for the AP Computer Science Principles exam, on which I received a 4.
